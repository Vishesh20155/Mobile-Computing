# Mobile-Computing
Repo for Mobile Computing course done in Semester 6, under Prof Mukulika Maity

The following apps were created:

[Body Motion Sensing App](https://github.com/Vishesh20155/Mobile-Computing/tree/assignment-5):

The app uses Accelerometer and Magnetometer to achieve the following:
* Draws Trajectory of the path taken
* Determines when Climbing up/down the stairs
* Detects Lift
* Determines distance and displacement of the person


[Sensors App](https://github.com/Vishesh20155/Mobile-Computing/tree/assignment-4):

App involves using Light Sensor, Geomagnetic Rotation Vector Sensor and Proximity Sensor.

Also implemented re-orienting the phone with earth's magnetic field using feedback of geomagnetic rotation vector sensor.


[Dictionary](https://github.com/Vishesh20155/Mobile-Computing/tree/assignment-3):

Uses [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev) to show the meaning, synonyms, antonyms, example usage of entered word.

Also implemented voice functionality that asynchronously downloads the audio file and then plays it.


[Alarm](https://github.com/Vishesh20155/Mobile-Computing/tree/assignment-2):
